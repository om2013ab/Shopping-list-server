This is the server side of Shopping List App. I built it using Ktor framework with Kotlin. 
The followings are the technologies and liberaries that I applied in building this server:

1) JWT authentication.
2) KMongo db.
3) Koin for dependency injection.
4) Hashing password

# Future Improvements:
1) Using Firebase Oauth with Ktor.
2) Deploying the server.
